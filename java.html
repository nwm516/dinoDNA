        <h5 class="pb-2">Why Java?</h5>
        <p class="pb-2">Java is a relatively easy programming language to learn, along with the added benefit of being
            an intergral part of many technological creations in our modern day. From banking to
            retail, the stock market to automobile manufacturing, Java's influence can be seen in a vast majority of technology around us
            (for example, many of the apps in the Android Play Store are built with Java). Typifying the "write once and run anywhere" adage, Java can play nicely with any device or
            machine that already supports the Java Virtual Machine, which again adds further to its versatility.</p>

        <p class="pb-2">Though having waned in popularity a small amount over recent years (mostly due to Python and
            JavaScript cutting ahead in popularity and usage), Java remains a titan of a
            programming language, despite being in the programming scene for nearly 30 years. Yet even after all of that time, Java is still a solid contender worth considering if you're in need of a new language to learn.

        <p>According to Simform and a survey put forth amongst language developers in 2022, this map shows the most
            popular and most Google'd languages around the world. Based upon their findings, Java and Python dominate
            the survey results.
