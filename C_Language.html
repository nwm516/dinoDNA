        	<h1>Why Study C/C++Programming</h1>
						<h3><br> Along with Python and Java, C forms a “good foundation” for learning how to program. As one of the first programming languages ever developed, C has served as the foundation for writing more modern languages such as Python, Ruby, and PHP. It is also an easy language to debug, test, and maintain.Because it can run on any type of device, C is often used to program hardware, such as embedded devices in automobiles and medical devices used in healthcare. </h3>

					<h2><br>C++</h2>
						<br><p>C++ was built as an extension of C. C++ is actually short for “C with classes.” Its main benefit as a programming language is high performance achieved in a memory-efficient manner. <br><br>C++ is the king of programming languages when it comes to programming video games. All the major consoles read C++ code. Therefore, if you are planning to create high-end video games, this may be the language for you. Despite it being heavily associated with video games, C++ is probably the most versatile language around. Apple and Microsoft both use C++ in their Operating systems. Internet browsers are mostly built with C++ as well.</p>

			 	  <h2><br>Advantages</h2>
						<br><li>As a middle-level language, C combines the features of both high-level and low-level languages. It can be used for low-level programming, such as scripting for drivers and kernels and it also supports functions of high-level programming languages, such as scripting for software applications etc.</li><br>
						<li>C is a structured programming language which allows a complex program to be broken into simpler programs called functions. It also allows free movement of data across these functions.</li>
						<br><li>Various features of C including direct access to machine level hardware APIs, the presence of C compilers, deterministic resource use and dynamic memory allocation make C language an optimum choice for scripting applications and drivers of embedded systems.</li>
